### [2024] Peer-to-Peer File Distribution System

This project develops a distributed peer-to-peer system for file sharing among clients, implemented using a combination of technologies such as C, Python, Bash, and SOAP-based web services. The solution integrates TCP socket communication, multithreaded execution, and remote procedure calls (RPC), all under a modular and scalable architecture. The client acts as a multithreaded interpreter, while the server handles concurrent requests, manages a binary database, and communicates with other modules. It also includes functional and concurrency tests across different operating systems, demonstrating its robustness and portability.

### [2024] Unsupervised Learning: Classification of Star Types

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify and classify different types of stars based on an astronomical dataset. The goal is to analyze whether traditional astronomical classifications can be reproduced using clustering algorithms and attribute encoding strategies.

Dataset:

The dataset contains 240 stars and the following attributes:

- `Temperature`: Surface temperature (K)
- `L`: Luminosity (relative to the Sun)
- `R`: Radius (relative to the Sun)
- `A_M`: Absolute magnitude
- `Color`: Spectral color
- `Spectral_Class`: Spectral class (O, B, A, F, G, K, M)

Implemented functionalities:

- Custom implementation of K-means:
    - A self-built K-means function is required.
    - Compare its performance and results with scikit-learnâ€™s version.

- Handling categorical variables:
    
    Two approaches compared:
    - One-hot encoding
    - Ordinal encoding based on physical order (e.g., energy or temperature)

- Application of multiple clustering algorithms:
    - In addition to K-means, at least one other algorithm is applied (such as DBSCAN or Agglomerative).
    - Compare results across algorithms and encoding methods.

- Results evaluation:
    - Discuss whether the resulting groups correspond to astronomical classes (white dwarf, supergiant, etc.).

- Clustering pipeline proposal:

### [2024] AJS Language Compiler: Lexical, Syntactic, and Semantic Analyzer

This project extends a previous assignment in which a lexical and syntactic analyzer was developed for the AJS language, a simplified version of JavaScript. In this project, the compiler is completed with a semantic analyzer, and previous parts are refactored for integration. The entire development is done in Python using the `PLY` library.

1. Lexical analyzer

    Uses regular expressions to identify language elements such as numbers (integers, reals, binaries, octals, hexadecimals, scientific notation), strings, characters, identifiers, operators, and reserved words. It handles comments and lexical errors, and includes automated tests to validate correct token recognition.

2. Syntactic analyzer

    Builds the syntax tree from tokens using precedence and production rules. It processes declarations, assignments, conditionals, loops, functions, and AJSON objects. The grammar is adapted to facilitate semantic analysis.

3. AJS grammar

    A detailed grammar is defined, covering expressions, complex structures, basic data types, nested object declarations, typed function parameters, and function calls.

4. Semantic analyzer

    Ensures program consistency in terms of types, declarations, and context. It manages global and local symbol tables, validates assignments, return types, object property access, and function overloading. It also ensures that conditions in loops and if-statements are boolean, and that blocks are not empty.

### [2024] Prototype of a Ubiquitous Virtual Shopping Cart

This prototype tackles the challenge of replacing traditional physical shopping carts with a solution based on the mobile device as a ubiquitous interaction interface. It is inspired by a realistic scenario such as *Black Friday* at El Corte InglÃ©s, where physical space becomes limited due to the large number of customers and carts.

The proposed solution integrates web technologies, mobile sensors (NFC, camera, accelerometer, microphone, vibration), and real-time communication via *socket.io*, turning the smartphone into a rich interaction device adapted to the physical store environment.

System structure:

- Client Web App (`/www/cliente`): allows the customer to perform all operations on the virtual cart (add, remove, pay, sort, etc.).
- Employee Web App (`/www/empleado`): allows the employee to view the customerâ€™s products and manage the payment and questions.
- Node.js Server (`index.js`): handles connection logic, registration, real-time communication, and access to JSON data.
- JSON files (`empleados.json`, `registro.json`, `clientes.json`, etc.): simulate a small database for users, employees, products, and questions.

Implemented functionalities:

- Ubiquitous interactions:

    1. Add product to cart â†’ Scan a QR code from the `QR` folder.
    2. Remove product â†’ Tap product and shake the device.
    3. Mark as favorite â†’ Double-click on a product.
    4. Sort cart â†’ Drag products up/down with touch gestures.
    5. Proximity payment (NFC + Bluetooth LE) â†’ Connect to a simulated checkout using *nRF Connect* with the `heart_rate` Bluetooth service. Payment occurs by bringing the phone close.

- Additional features:

    6. Login and registration for clients and employees â†’ Password validation, persistence in `.json` files.
    7. Real-time Q&A system â†’ Client sends questions by voice or text; employee responds and both interfaces sync via WebSocket.
    8. Coupons unlockable by motion â†’ Coupons appear when the phone is shaken and apply automatically at checkout.
    9. Product search and indoor geolocation â†’ Client searches for a product, it is displayed on a map, and its position updates as the device moves (simulated).

Technologies used:

- `Node.js` + `Express.js`

- `socket.io` for real-time communication

- Web Interaction APIs:
  - `DeviceMotion` and `TouchEvent` for gestures
  - `Web Speech API` for voice input
  - `Web NFC` and `Bluetooth Low Energy` for ubiquitous payment

### [2023] Data Structures and Algorithms

This Data Structures and Algorithms project is divided into two complementary phases: the first expands the functionalities of singly linked lists with advanced operations such as sequence deletion, rotations, and loop detection; the second extends binary search trees with algorithms to calculate distances between nodes and to combine trees through set operations.

1. Phase 1: Operations on Singly Linked Lists (`SList2`)

In this first phase, the `SList2` class is developed as an extension of the singly linked list (`SList`), incorporating advanced methods to manipulate and fix the list structure.

Implemented functionalities:
- `delLargestSeq()`

    Removes the longest sequence of consecutive elements with the same value. It traverses the list looking for repeated sequences, deletes the longest one, and correctly updates the list size.

- `fix_loop()`

    Detects and removes loops in the linked list. It checks whether any node points back to a previous one. If a cycle is detected, it cuts the reference to break the loop. Returns True if a loop was found and corrected, False otherwise.

- `create_loop(position)`

    Auxiliary method to force an artificial loop in the list by linking the last node to an intermediate one. Useful for testing the previous method.

- `leftrightShift(left, n)`

    Rotates the list: If `left=True`, it moves the first `n` nodes to the end. If `left=False`, it moves the last `n` nodes to the beginning. Uses an auxiliary list and updates pointers efficiently.

2. Phase 2: Operations on Binary Search Trees (`BST2`)

In this second phase, the `BST2` class is implemented as an extension of the binary search tree (`BinarySearchTree`), adding advanced methods for tree analysis and manipulation, such as computing distances between nodes and combining trees via set operations. AVL trees are used as output to ensure balance.

Implemented functionalities:
- `find_dist_k(n, k)`

    Returns a list of all nodes in the tree that are exactly `k` links away from the node with value `n`. The method locates the target node and computes the distance to each other node by determining their Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) and summing relative depths. It uses recursive search and helper functions.

- `create_tree(input_tree1, input_tree2, opc)`

    Generates a new AVL tree by applying a set operation between two input trees (`input_tree1`, `input_tree2`) based on the `opc` parameter. Supported operations are:
  
    - `merge`: Returns a tree containing the union of elements from both trees.
    - `intersection`: Returns a tree with elements common to both trees.
    - `difference`: Returns a tree with elements present in the first tree but not in the second.

    Each operation recursively traverses the input nodes and inserts the appropriate elements into the resulting AVL tree.
